# GMTK-game-jam-2023
**Prompt**: Roles Reversed

**Inspirations**: Papers Please, Stardew Valley

**Idea**: A stressful Stardew Valley-like

**Setting**: A fantasy setting where the monstrous forces are the human kingdom encroaching on the goblin's land. There are resistance goblin fighters.

**Player Role**: Not a resistance fighter, but a goblin subsistance farmer trying to survive and grow crops

**Calendar system**: On every passing day you spend action points to plant and water crops.
* You only have as many AP as you are full, so you'll have to eat some of your crops too
* Each day you can:
	* Eat food (+AP)
	* Plant/water crops (-AP)
	* Random event (choices and consequences)
* Time advances during the day and that can affect when the random event occurs and so you might have sold or eaten food already

**Win condition**: Survive as long as possible, or until the war ends, with an option to keep playing or start a new run.
* The war ends on day 20(?) at which point we'll flip a coin that is weighted by how much you supported either faction to determine the winner.

**Random Events (maybe add fixed events later)**
	* Griffin infestation (they eat your crops until you pull them off, takes AP and receives a wound)
	* Robber demands either money or crops (you pick), or you fight them off (takes AP and maybe receives a wound)
	* Starving child and mother show up, begging for food (give or don't)
	* Tax collection from either faction (money only or else a severe warning)
	* Nearby battle, your plot is damaged
	* Drought, watering costs twice as much AP for the day
	* Recruitment to the cause to fight for the goblins (if yes, + goblin faction points, but you get wounded affecting your AP)
	* Injured soldier appears asking for help (give food, or turn over to other faction for money)
	* Hide an injured human in your house
	* Inspector shows up (if they find a human then they get killed and you pay a fine)
	* Mercenaries show up demaning protection money (they will protect you for the next robbery/griffin attack)
	* Rain (no AP to water crops)
	* War treasure washes up on the river (money and/or health potion)
	* Merchants show up for better prices (they also sell health potions rarely)
**Fail conditions (result in the end of a run)**
	* Starving
	* Death for not paying taxes
	* Killed as a goblin traitor
	* 3 wounds = death

## Technical details
* One main screen which is the player farm, top down 2D camera view ala Star Dew Valley
* Small plot of land and a tiny house
* Start with two crops: cheap and 1 day to grow, expensive and 3 days to grow
* 2D Tile Map
* The farm is the only space the player moves in
* Money as a separate system from the Food+Seed inventory
* Clicking on a plot asks you which of your inventory seeds you'd like to plant (takes AP)
* Clicking on a plant waters it (takes AP)
* A grown plant will be added to inventory when interacted with (takes AP)
* Starvation affects the AP you start with the next day
* For random events, new character sprite show up on the farm and trigger a character portrait dialog system with choices
* Magic computer for ordering more seeds, either from the humans or other goblins, that arrive 24 hours later

*Important questions:*
* What is the alternative to planting? What makes it a tricky decision?
