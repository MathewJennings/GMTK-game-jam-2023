# GMTK-game-jam-2023

Dry run prompt: Joined Together

Inspirations:
* Bread and Fred -- two entities bound together in a puzzle platformer, physics based
** Some puzzles require certain rope swings
* Pogostuck: in 2-player mode, the players are tethered together and must advance through obstacles
** Tethering unlocks interesting movement options
* Fire boy and water girl -- one person can solve puzzles for the other and help them advance
* Banjo and Kazooie
** What if Kazooie was swappable and you could use different powers?
* Visual story novels? Dating sims
* Social deduction game -- where the traitors are joined together
* Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
** Assymtrical cooperative puzzle solving
* Henry Stickman: make choices to advance the story and explore their repercussions

Mechanical ideas:
Chained together but can be broken?
* Mechanic: breaking the chain causes something to happen, reset on a timer
** Kinda like Cut the Rope
* Hurting one enemy or ally can hurt a connected enemy or ally
** A choice-driven game with consequences that affect multiple characters
* An expression of "The Prisoners' Dilemma"
** Semi-cooperative games? E.g. goal is to climb the mountain. If one player betrays the other then they get more equipment to help them climb.
*** Group object + a potentially competing individual objective
* 1 Player controls 2 characters
** Each character has a different objective. E.g. rougelite, get buffs for one character but perhaps to the detriment of the others
** Should the traits of the 2 characters be fixed or change?
** One could be defensive and one could be offensive
** Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime: each character can only control one subsystem of the spaceship, like shields, weapons, thrust, etc.

Tasks:
* [Sam] Implement movement for two different characters at once
* [Jenn] Add 2 characters/animations
   ** Need an enemy and an item to move
* [Franklin] Scripts for char. A to lift and move things and char. B to fight things, general game state
* [Cho] Map/room: goal is to reach the end
   ** There's an item that needs to be moved and an enemy that needs to be defeated
* [Felix] Health/lose system if enemy touches a character
